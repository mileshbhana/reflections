1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Basic repository metadata is created on local PC. 
It transformed a simple directory into a repository root. 

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a temp space that allows you to consolidate various files before committing a full change. 
Very useful for multiple file commits.
