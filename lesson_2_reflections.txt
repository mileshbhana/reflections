Lesson 2 Reflections 

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Basic repository metadata is created on local PC. 
It transformed a simple directory into a repository root. 

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a temp space that allows you to consolidate various files before committing a full change. 
Very useful for multiple file commits. 

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only files that relate to current change, or make my own branch. 

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Experimental Change
Equivalent to  "Revision Label" that we use in Star Team. (Can use a single commit, but this may be better)

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Simple graph gives a good idea of reachability.
git log --graph --oneline <label1> <label2> is handy.
